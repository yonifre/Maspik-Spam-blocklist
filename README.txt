Eliminate spam. Block specific words, IP, country, languages, Spam API and more!

== Description ==

Are you getting spam emails through your contact forms?
MASPIK will help you stop spam coming through your Elementor + CF7 forms + Wordpress Comments & Registration (plus Gravityforms + Wpforms + Woocommerce reviews & Registration if you active pro license).
Block/blacklist specific words, IP, country, languages, and more – MASPIK blocks the spam that ReCaptcha doesn’t block.

If you look through your spam emails, you can often find the same words repeated. Sometimes they are in a foreign language, and other times they are from the same country or even IP.
One example of common words in spam email is “Eric Jones”, “SEO Ranking”, “Automatically submit your website” , "Get free".

MASPIK can block form spam emails from being delivered to your inbox!

Note:
The plugin allows you to manually blacklist the words you select.
Each website has different needs, so be careful with the words you choose to blacklist. For example, if you are a digital marketing agency and block the word SEO, you will likely lose some valid leads.
